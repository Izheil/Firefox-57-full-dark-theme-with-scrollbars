<h1>JS function installers</h1>
<p>If you don't want to copy the files manually to install multirow, tabs below, or focus tab on hover, you can do it with this installer.</p>
<b>Make sure your Firefox is up to date, since the userscripts installed with this assume you have the lastest firefox version.</b>.</p>
<p>This is the python version of the installer. For the actual installer go to the <a href="https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme/releases">releases</a> page.</p>
<p>You need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/">Python 3.7</a> installed to use these, along with the <b>elevate</b> module.</p>

<p>In linux you might need to install pip (to install the elevate module) after installing Python 3.7, which you can do with:</p>
<code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code>

<p>You can install the required module after installing Python and pip using:</p>
<code>pip3 install elevate</code>

<h3>Non scrollable multirow tabs</h3>
<p>This version of multirow tabs shows all tabs you currently have open splitting them on rows, without any limit to the amount of rows to show. Choose this option if you want to always see all the tabs you have open without limits to the number of rows.</p>

<h3>Scrollable multirow tabs</h3>
<p>This version shows all tabs you currently have open splitting them on rows up to a max of 3 rows by default (can be changed using the variable inside the file). After the max number of rows has been reached, a scrollbar will be shown to be able to scroll around the extra tabs.</p>
