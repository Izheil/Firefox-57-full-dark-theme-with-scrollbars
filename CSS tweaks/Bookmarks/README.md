# Bookmark toolbar fixes

### Autohide-bookmarks-toolbar.as.css
This file will hide the bookmarks toolbar when you aren't hovering the mouse over the navigation box.

### Bookmarks-on-fullscreen.as.css
By default Firefox hides the bookmarks toolbar and the titlebar while on Fullscreen. This file will show these.
Don't use this file if you are using `bookmarks-toggle.uc.js`.

### Multirow-bookmarks.as.css
The bookmarks toolbar will show more than 1 row when overflowing the toolbar instead of showing the "v" button to show the rest.
Similar to multirow tabs.
