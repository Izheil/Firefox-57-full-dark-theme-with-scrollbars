# Urlbar fixes

### Megabar-disabled-all-resizing.as.css
Since Firefox 76, the address bar now resizes when you open a new tab or when it's on focus. This will disable the resizing effect, along with the shadows that come with it.

### Megabar-disabled-until-focus.as.css
Since Firefox 76, the address bar now resizes when you open a new tab or when it's on focus. This will disable the resizing effect until you have focused the urlbar by clicking on it. This means that it won't resize when you for example open a new tab.

### Urlbar-font.as.css
This changes the font of the urlbar so that it's easier for the user to detect url spoofing. Georgia font is used by default, but you can choose any other one that you want editing the value in the file.
